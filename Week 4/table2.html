	<p id="text">Practicing HTML is fun. <em>So far</em> we have learned <b>HTML</b> is a language made of tags that help us describe how we want our webpages to look. We have tried the head, title. H (heading) and paragraph tags so far. Very few people know all the tags in HTML, but that is okay because we can do a lot with just some basic tags. We can learn about new tags when we need them.</p>
